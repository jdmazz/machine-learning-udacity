# machine-learning-udacity
Machine learning projects for Udacity. I have professional Kaggle projects in a separate repo. In most cases, these are algorithms that learn for themselves what decision to make by trying some things out, usually with gradient descent methods underlying them.

Also, these make use of Python 2.7, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook, if you want to run them.
